# Vercel 404 Error Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
Despite implementing routing fixes, the website still returns 404 errors on all routes except the homepage when accessed via `springbase.com.ng`.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Check Vercel Domain Configuration
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Navigate to your project settings
- Check the "Domains" section
- Ensure `springbase.com.ng` is properly configured
- Verify the domain is pointing to the correct Vercel project

### 2. Verify DNS Configuration
Your DNS records should point to Vercel:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Type: CNAME  
Name: @
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### 3. Check Vercel Project Settings
- Ensure the project is set to "Production" environment
- Verify the build command is `npm run build`
- Confirm output directory is `dist`
- Check that the framework is detected as "Vite"

## Alternative Configuration Approaches

### Option 1: Minimal vercel.json
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/((?!api/).*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option 2: Using routes instead of rewrites
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/((?!api/).*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option 3: Netlify-style _redirects
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs**
   - Look for any build errors
   - Verify the `_redirects` file is being copied
   - Check if `vercel.json` is being recognized

2. **Test with Vercel Preview URL**
   - Deploy to a preview URL first
   - Test routing on the preview domain
   - If it works there, the issue is with custom domain

3. **Verify File Structure in dist/**
   - Ensure `index.html` exists
   - Check that `_redirects` is present
   - Verify `vercel.json` is copied

4. **Domain Propagation**
   - DNS changes can take 24-48 hours
   - Test with different DNS servers
   - Use tools like `whatsmydns.net`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Domain not properly linked to Vercel
**Solution**: Re-add the domain in Vercel dashboard

### Issue: DNS not pointing to Vercel
**Solution**: Update DNS records to point to Vercel

### Issue: SSL certificate not active
**Solution**: Wait for SSL provisioning (can take up to 24 hours)

### Issue: Vercel not recognizing configuration
**Solution**: Try different configuration formats

## Next Steps

1. **Verify domain configuration** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Check DNS records** are pointing to Vercel
3. **Test with preview URL** first
4. **Clear browser cache** and test in incognito
5. **Wait for DNS propagation** if changes were made
6. **Contact Vercel support** if issue persists

## Emergency Fallback

If routing still doesn't work:
1. Consider using Vercel's default domain temporarily
2. Test if routing works on the default domain
3. If yes, the issue is with custom domain configuration
4. If no, the issue is with the routing configuration itself
