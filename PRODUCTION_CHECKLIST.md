# Production Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checks

### 1. Code Quality
- [x] All hardcoded values removed
- [x] Environment variables properly configured
- [x] Fallback systems in place
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] CORS headers configured

### 2. API Functions
- [x] `/api/schedule-tour` - Tour scheduling with calendar integration

- [x] All components use centralized configuration

### 4. Configuration System
- [x] `src/lib/config.ts` - Centralized configuration
- [x] Environment variable support
- [x] Automatic fallback to working SMTP settings
- [x] No hardcoded credentials in production code

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables (Vercel Dashboard)
Set these in your Vercel project settings:

```bash
# Required for production
SMTP_HOST=mail.springbase.com.ng
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USER=info@springbase.com.ng
SMTP_PASS=your_actual_smtp_password
MAIL_FROM=Springbase Schools <info@springbase.com.ng>
SCHOOL_TO_EMAIL=info@springbase.com.ng
APP_ORIGIN=https://www.springbase.com.ng
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready: centralized config, calendar integration, no hardcoded values"
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy from GitHub
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Check Vercel build logs for errors
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints respond
- [ ] Test tour scheduling form
- [ ] Test contact form
- [ ] Test newsletter subscription
- [ ] Check email delivery

## 🔧 Testing Checklist

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev:full  # Starts frontend + local API server
```
- [ ] Tour scheduling works locally
- [ ] Contact form works locally
- [ ] Newsletter subscription works locally
- [ ] Local storage fallback works

### Production Testing
- [ ] Tour scheduling works on live site
- [ ] Contact form works on live site
- [ ] Newsletter subscription works on live site
- [ ] Calendar invitations are sent
- [ ] Both parties receive emails

## 📧 Email Functionality

### What's Working
- ✅ SMTP configuration with environment variables
- ✅ Automatic fallback to direct IP if env vars fail

4. Check if your hosting provider blocks SMTP

### If Forms Return 500 Errors
1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Verify all required environment variables
3. Check CORS configuration
4. Verify API endpoint URLs
